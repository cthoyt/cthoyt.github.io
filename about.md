I fell in love with chemistry in high school - back then it was about making
things change color and/or explode. I was sold. My high school was down the
street from Yale University and they let a few seniors enroll for a class there
each semester. I took freshmen chemistry, which turned out to basically be an
applied calculus class in thermodynamics and quantum mechanics. I didn't know
calculus back then.

I shipped up to Boston (as one does) to join the Department of Chemistry and
Chemical Biology at Northeastern University. I was totally enchanted by my 
organic chemistry professor, Prof. Mike Pollastri, and joined his lab to learn
synthetic organic chemistry. As I became more familiar with the lab's focus
on medicinal chemistry for neglected tropical disease drug discovery, I became
further motivated by the humanitarian nature of the work. I also became more
interested in the biological aspects of the work.

From there, I continued with medicinal chemistry in my first co-op (i.e.,
full-time, 6 month internship between semesters) at GlaxoSmithKline. My
co-workers took great interest in the co-ops and gave us the chance to learn
about the other aspects of drug discovery programs, from target prioritization
to validation to hit to lead. I was particularly interested in the
computational team supporting the DNA-encoded library screening platform. I had
also fallen in love with computer science in high school, but I didn't realize
I could do both until I saw how they worked.

By chance, my postdoc mentor in Pollastri's lab, Emanuele Amata, had been doing
an externship in the Computational Sciences Center of Excellence in Pfizer 
possible due to Pollastri's history of working at Pfizer in Groton (in the
good ol' days). After realizing the potential of computational applications in
chemistry and biology, I found my way into doing an internship in the same
group where I trained as a software engineer then as a bioinformatician. I
followed that experience with many more classes in statistics, mathematics,
and computer science before joining the *in-silico* Lead Discovery team in the
Center for Proteomic Chemistry at Novartis where I worked on mechanism of
action deconvolution using their "Mechanism of Action Box" screening platform.

I was advised by co-workers at Novartis to move to Bonn, Germany and join the
Life Science Informatics master's program at the Bonn-Aachen International Center
for Information Technology in the University of Bonn. So I did. I joined the
group of Prof. Martin Hofmann-Apitius jointly with the Fraunhofer Institute for
Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI) working on using network-based
approaches for target identification in neurodegenerative diseases.

That work evolved into my master's thesis on the development of a general
framework for hypothesis generation using knowledge assembly approaches in
networks and systems biology. I continued my work during my Ph.D. at Fraunhofer
to bridge the gap between systems biology and cheminformatics for
mechanistically informed patient stratification, drug identification, and drug
repurposing. Following my Ph.D., I had a few months to continue my work in 
further interfacing machine learning and knowledge graphs in the biomedical
domain and applications across a range of topics.

As I entered 2020, I had planned on taking some well-deserved time off. The
work I had started was nowhere near done, but it was time for a break before returning
to academia for a postdoc. Because the pandemic made it a bad year for a vacation,
I spent 10 months at Enveda Biosciences to build their semantics, knowledge
graph, and machine learning platforms, which played an important role in securing
their second round of venture capital funding. I also joined CoronaWhy to advise
on the same topics and reproducibility in computational science.

In 2021, I joined the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School to 
continue my academic work.

I'm also a real person, too! I love making music, watching movies/TV, running,
and traveling. I've been to 30 countries so far and tried beer in almost all
of them. I have yet to enjoy it.
