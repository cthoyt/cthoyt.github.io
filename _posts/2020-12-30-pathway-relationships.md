Domingo-Fernandez *et al.* published [ComPath: An ecosystem for exploring, analyzing,
and curating mappings across pathway databases.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41540-018-0078-8)
in 2018 describing the overlap between human pathways in KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways.
A lot of the underlying machinery I developed to support this project has been improved since,
and it's time to spread the search to other organisms besides humans and other databases.
This blog post is about some additional relation types needed to capture the relations
between pathways appearing in these databases.
