The [Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls)
is a widely used biomedical and clinical vocabulary maintained by the United States
National Library of Medicine. However, it is notoriously difficult to access and work
with due to licensing restrictions and its complex download system.
In the same vein as my previous posts about [DrugBank]({% post_url 2020-12-14-taming-drugbank %}) and
[ChEMBL]({% post_url 2021-08-05-taming-chembl-sql %}), this post
describes [open source software](https://github.com/cthoyt/umls_downloader)
I've developed for downloading and working with this data. It also works
for [RxNorm](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/docs/rxnormfiles.html),
[SemMedDB](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/ii/tools/SemRep_SemMedDB_SKR/SemMedDB_download.html), [SNOMED-CT](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/healthit/snomedct/international.html),
and any other data accessible through
the [UMLS Terminology Services (UTS) ticket granting system](https://documentation.uts.nlm.nih.gov/automating-downloads.html).

The first big issue with the UMLS is its licensing. Here's an excerpt from the
[How to License and Access the Unified Medical Language System® (UMLS®) Data](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/umls.html)
page accessed on August 28<sup>th</sup>, 2023:

> 1. Please sign up for a new UMLS Terminology Services (UTS) account with your preferred identity provider at the UTS
     homepage.
> 2. Complete and submit the license request form. NLM will send the license approval e-mail within 5 business days
     after reviewing your authenticated license request.
> 3. You will sign in using identity provider credentials to download files or access web interfaces that require UTS
     authentication such as the UTS, VSAC, SNOMED CT, or RxNorm.

These are a few big hurdles:

1. We typically expect scientific data to be available for download without login. Specifically, most data can be
   downloaded by following a link that points directly to a file. For example, ChEMBL v33 can be downloaded as a gzipped
   SQLite file
   from [https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/ChEMBLdb/latest/chembl_33_sqlite.tar.gz](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/ChEMBLdb/latest/chembl_33_sqlite.tar.gz).
   Rather than providing a data download link, UMLS, has a complicated API called the UMLS Terminology Services (UTS)
   ticket granting system that needs to be asked for a specific file, polled for a unique access key, then downloaded
   via an ephemeral (i.e., disappearing) URL that only works once.
2. We typically expect scientific data to be licensed under a standard, widely used license such as those from
   [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org). Using well-understood licenses reduces the cognitive and legal
   burden of consumers when deciding if and how they can reuse, modify, or redistribute data. UMLS uses a non-standard
   [terms of service](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/umls.html) that makes it more difficult to understand how the
   data can be stored, modified, or redistributed.
3. Further, we hope that data is permissively licensed such that it can be re-used, modified, and
   re-distributed. The Creative Commons [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
   and [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) licenses are golden standards of permissibility. UMLS
   does not have a permissive license,
   meaning (from my best interpretation) that you can not redistribute UMLS and you can (probably) not redistribute data
   derived from UMLS. As an aside, Creative Commons also has license containing clauses to be explicit about
   restrictions such as the share-alike (SA), non-commercial (NC), and non-distribution (ND). While these clauses aren't
   ideal for scientific data, it would at least be nice for UMLS to use a Creative Commons license with the appropriate
   combination of these clauses (I guess all three) to make it more explicit about its restrictions.
4. The most bizarre facet of UMLS is that they require you to fill out a user survey each year to keep access.

I want to 1) convert UMLS into an [OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) ontology and 2) extract and encode
its semantic mappings to external vocabularies like the [Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)](https://bioregistry.iomesh)
with [Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings  (SSSOM)](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom). Given
all of these hurdles, it's probably the case that I am not allowed to redistribute these artifacts.

All together, I consider this a big bummer. The United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) maintains several
highly influential resources, but I have found in many instances that they lack a community perspective. Regardless,
even as an expat, I pay American taxes, and it makes me upset that the government funds the development and maintenance
of resources that I can't easily use.

## How To Break Free

![A clip of Queen's "I Want to Break Free" music video](https://media.tenor.com/lfjcIHfOhqoAAAAC/freddie-mercury-queen.gif)

Despite all of this rigamarole, there's a process to subvert these issues by automating the
interaction with the [UMLS Terminology Services (UTS)](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts) and therefore enabling automated
download of UMLS and the following (non-exhaustive) list of resources:

- [RxNorm](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/docs/rxnormfiles.html)
- [SemMedDB](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/ii/tools/SemRep_SemMedDB_SKR/SemMedDB_download.html)
- [SNOMED-CT](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/healthit/snomedct/international.html)
- potentially more in the future

This has been implemented in the open source [`umls_downloader`](https://github.com/cthoyt/umls-downloader) Python
package. It can be installed with the following one-liner in your shell:

```shell
$ pip install umls_downloader
```

Below, I'll walk you through using it.
Throughout, keep in mind that full documentation for the `umls_downloader` is available
at [umls-downloader.readthedocs.io](https://umls-downloader.readthedocs.io), which describes the other functionality and
other data that can be downloaded.

### Usage

UMLS has three different distributions that are
described [here](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html).
The following Python code downloads the most simple and straightforward file, `MRCONSO.RRF` as a zip archive:

```python
from umls_downloader import download_umls

path = download_umls(version="2023AA", api_key="<your API key>")
```

This code is smart and does not need to download the file more than once.
It uses [`pystow`](https://github.com/cthoyt/pystow) to choose a stable path `~/.data/bio/umls` relative to the current
user's home directory. Inside this directory, it also uses the version of the data to create a subdirectory. Finally,
this function returns the path to the data, such that no file paths ever need to be hard-coded.

> **Warning**
> This still requires an API key, which requires creating an account, agreeing to UMLS's terms and conditions,
> etc. This can be done here: [https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/edit-profile](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/edit-profile).

### Automating Configuration of UTS Credentials

There are two ways to automatically set the API key, so you don't
have to worry about getting it and passing it around in your python code:

1. Set `UMLS_API_KEY` in the environment. This can be done in your interactive session or in the configuration for your
   shell such as in a `.bashrc` file for the Bourne Again Shell (bash).
2. Create `~/.config/umls.ini` and set in the `[umls]` section a `api_key` key. Mine looks like:
   ```ini
   [umls]
   api_key=1234567890abcdefghijklmno
   ```

Now you can omit the `api_key` keyword like in the following:

```python
from umls_downloader import download_umls

# Same path as before
path = download_umls(version="2023AA")
```

### Download the Latest Version

First, you'll have to
install [`bioversions`](https://github.com/cthoyt/bioversions)
with `pip install bioversions`, whose job it is to look up the latest version of
many databases. Then, you can modify the previous code slightly by omitting
the `version` keyword argument:

```python
from umls_downloader import download_umls

# Same path as before (when run on September 1st, 2023)
path = download_umls()
```

### Download and open the file

The UMLS file is zipped, so it's usually accompanied by the following
boilerplate code:

```python
import zipfile
from umls_downloader import download_umls

path = download_umls()
with zipfile.ZipFile(path) as zip_file:
    with zip_file.open("MRCONSO.RRF", mode="r") as file:
        for line in file:
            ...
```

This exact code is wrapped with the `umls_downloader.open_umls()` using Python's context manager,
so it can more simply be written as:

```python
from umls_downloader import open_umls

with open_umls() as file:
    for line in file:
        ...
```

> **Note**
> The `version` and `api_key` arguments work the same for `umls_downloader.open_umls()`
> as in `umls_downloader.download_umls()`

At this point, it's up to you to decide how you want to consume the `MRCONSO.RRF` file.
Below, I give a demo on how parsed this file in PyOBO in order to convert UMLS to an
OWL ontology.

## Why not an API?

The UMLS provides an [API](https://documentation.uts.nlm.nih.gov/rest/home.html)
for access to tiny bits of data at a time. There are even two recent (last 5
years) packages [`umls-api`](https://pypi.org/project/umls-api)
[`connect-umls`](https://pypi.org/project/connect-umls) that provide a wrapper
around them. However, API access is generally rate limited, difficult to use in
bulk, and slow. For working with UMLS (or any other database, for that matter) in
bulk, it's necessary to download full database dumps.

## UMLS Mappings

One of the nice qualities of UMLS is that it is a semantic mapping hub. It provides mostly complete mappings
between many vocabularies
including [MeSH](https://bioregistry.io/mesh), [NCIT](https://bioregistry.io/ncit), [SNOMED-CT](https://bioregistry.io/snomedct),
[HPO](https://bioregistry.io/hpo), [LOINC](https://bioregistry.io/loinc), and more.

Building on top of the automated download of UMLS, I used implemented a fit-for-purpose processor with the
[PyOBO framework](https://github.com/pyobo/pyobo) that converts UMLS into
an ontology (encoded either as OWL, OBO, or OBO Graph JSON) which can therefore be used to generate semantic mappings in
the SSSOM format. The code that implements this can be
found [here](https://github.com/pyobo/pyobo/commit/be67eadf77afa270cf224cad71d5b1905ae78b53).

Ultimately, the mappings can be accessed as a dataframe with the following lines of Python code
(after `pip install pyobo`):

```python
import pyobo

df = pyobo.get_sssom_df("umls", names=False)
df.to_csv("umls.sssom.tsv", sep="\t", index=False)
```

> **Note**
> You can set `names=True` to have PyOBO look up the names for all entities, but this is a bit of a rabbit hole
> since it requires getting and processing many external resources.

There's much more to say about UMLS and SSSOM, but this is a good place to pause and publish this post, since
getting UMLS as SSSOM is a task a lot of people have asked me for help with lately. I might also come back
and explain more about how I use the other resources from UMLS's UTS.
