During the community meeting portion of
the [14th Annual Biocuration Conference](https://www.biocuration.org/14th-annual-biocuration-conference-virtual/),
there was a short discussion about the notably underutilized budget of
the [International Society for Biocuration](https://www.biocuration.org) that
included a call for ideas for new small funding schemes. Since a lot of recent
discussions with potential external stakeholders about the
[Bioregistry](https://bioregistry.io) have devolved into discussions about
sustainability and longevity, I realized this would be the perfect opportunity
to propose a small funding scheme to assuage these kinds of concerns for small
projects like ours.
