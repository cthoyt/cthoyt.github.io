Here's the books I read in 2024. If I were Dudley Dursley, I'd be very upset
that I read one fewer new book than [in
2023]({% post_url 2024-01-01-books-in-2023 %}). But then, I'd remember that I
re-read a lot of Cosmere in 2024 to prepare for \_Wind and Truth), which was
great.

### What I Loved (minor spoilers):

1. Every single short story in Exhalation. You can check out my favorite,
   [The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate](https://images.shulcloud.com/1202/uploads/Documents/TheMerchantandtheAlchemistsGate.pdf),
   which is about how to find meaning in time travel, even if you can't change
   anything.
2. The Alchemist. It beats you over the head with its moral philosophy about
   seizing your destiny. It's great.
3. The sci-fi in the whole Three Body Problem trilogy. Lots of great ideas, even
   if the characters were weak at moments. I initially didn't like Luo Ji, but
   he eventually had a great arc which I've come to understand follows a more
   typical Chinese archetype.
4. Lady Trent has such a great tone and voice as a narrator. The epistolary
   format worked so well for these books.
5. Fifth ideals!

### Non-superlative Comments

1. Last year, I wrote that I wasn't a big fan of Murderbot #1. I stand by my
   criticism of the first book, but I'm glad I tried the rest, because it
   addressed my qualms and was a lot of fun.
2. ACOTAR would have definitely benefited from having a major revision to
   tighten up the story and characters, but I am sad when people trash on it. I
   enjoyed it.

### Disappointments

1. I started Persuasion by Jane Austen, but I didn't care for any of the
   characters, so I haven't finished it yet.
2. I heard so many times that The Fifth Season and its sequels were great. The
   first book had a cool premise and cool reveal at the end, but the second and
   third book just didn't have any good characters or plot to hold it together.
   I should have put it down after the second book, but I just assumed that
   since each installment won a Hugo award, that there was a massive payoff at
   the end. There was not.
3. There weren't enough Brandon Sandwiches, so I read his non-Cosmere novel, The
   Rithmatist, that will never get a sequel. When will I learn?
4. I'm very disappointed by the Netflix adaptation of Three Body Problem for not
   doing a better job of rewriting the characters. How can anyone in Hollywood
   trust Benioff and Weiss after Game of Thrones?

### Funny Story

When I was in Gasp√© over the summer, we were hanging out at a cafe that
suggested Simple Passion by Annie Ernaux as the book of the week. My sister and
I figured, we could read it and make some friends that week if they also had. We
didn't find anyone else who even noticed the sign about it being book of the
week.
