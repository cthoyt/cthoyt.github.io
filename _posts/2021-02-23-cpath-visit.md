In late 2017, I visited the [Critical Path Institute](https://c-path.org/) in Tucson, Arizona with
my colleague Daniel Domingo-Fern√°ndez to use
our [Alzheimer's disease map](https://neurommsig.scai.fraunhofer.de/) encoded in the
[Biological Expression Language](https://biological-expression-language.github.io/) and the tools we
built in [PyBEL](https://github.com/pybel/pybel) to help contextualize their predictive models for
mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We got very interesting results, but they had a major overlap with
unpublished work of one of our colleagues on the role of
[KANSL1](https://identifiers.org/hgnc:24565) in Alzheimer's disease, so we never reported them. Last
week, the [paper](https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-201397) finally made it publication
(congratulations, Sepehr!) so I thought it would be fun to rehash the old results and look at how
the results might have changed over time with improvements to the underlying knowledge graph.
