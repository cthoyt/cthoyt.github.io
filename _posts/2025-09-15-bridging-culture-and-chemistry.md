1. Get ICONCLASS into PyOBO
2. make mappings between ICONCLASS and chemicals in ChEBI or instruments in CHMO/OBI -> then we can look up depictions of the chemicals
   1. Tried to do normal biomappings
   1. Enable PyOBO to generate full ontology embedding dataframes
   2. Hack up biomappings to do full ontology embedding-based mapping
3. automate turning SSSOM into RDF
4. Making a federated query 3 ways between chem, culture, and the bridge that finds links between culture objects tagged with icon classes mapped to chemicals mapped to notebooks.
