This stub post contains my notes about funding for open source software. It
doesn't follow a story like a lot of my posts, and is more like an ever-evolving
notes sheet.

Here's a list of resources for getting funding for open source, which also
covers fiscal sponsorship:

- [FLOSS/fund](https://floss.fund/)
- [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/)
- [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/)
- [CZI EOSS](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/)

Interesting blog posts about open source funding:

  (this one is really good, basically a superset of my list)
