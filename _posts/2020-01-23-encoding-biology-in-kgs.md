How many molecular biology papers have you read today? This week?
This month? If you're like me, its not so many, and we're falling
behind very quickly. Here's a chart made by the *new* PubMed that
summarizes how many papers were published mentioning RAS in the
last 50 years.

![RAS Histogram](/img/ras_pubmed_history.png)

There were 4,483 publications listed in 2019. We can't read that
much, and even if we did, we couldn't remember it all. That's why
we need to take the knowledge out of the unstructured text and store
it in a structured form that can be read and stored in computers.
This way, we can easily share it, query it, and write algorithms that
can help us reason about the incredible amount of biological
knowledge out there.

There are several formats in which this kind of information can be
stored on a continuum between directly representing mechanistic
biology to representing the knowledge itself. In the popular middle
ground are BioPAX and BEL, which I'll come back to in future posts.

It's important to keep in mind that knowledge needs to be curated -
this can either be manual, through natural language processing, or
a mixture of both. I've written [a paper](https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baz068/5521414)
on such a process, but for now this post should motivate a few
following ones describing what it takes to deal with nomenclature,
build ontologies, and then start extracting mechanistic biology from
the literature.
