If you've ever read a scientific paper, you know that the information that makes it into the author affiliations is a
mess. I'm a big fan of [Manubot](https://manubot.org/) and fully support its mission to upend the modern scientific
publishing model. Like how they use structured [ORCID identifiers](https://orcid.org/) for identifying authors in
manuscript metadata, they are also working towards using [ROR identifiers](https://ror.org) for organizations. There are
still a few growing pains for ROR, so I chimed in on a [discussion](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/issues/155) on
GitHub about how Wikidata might be a potential solution for organizing and retrieving information about reserach
organizations. I said I'd describe my idea more in detail, so here I go!

## Step 1: Wikidata

[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) is an open, community-curated platform of knowledge. It stores entities, their
relations to other entities, their relations to scalar values, and added context for each relationship. Typically,
relationships have a subject, relation, and object and can be read like a simple sentence in the english language.

There are lots of working groups that maintain its ontology (i.e., the rules for how curation should be done) around
certain domains, such representing organization structures. This means there are lots of tools already built in to
Wikidata for potential curators like you and me to create rich pages for their organizations.

One of the curation rules shared across all domains in Wikidata is that each entity should have a "type". This means on
the page for [Albert Einstein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q937), there is a relationship stating he is an
[instance of](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P31) a [human](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5). The "instance of"
item on Wikidata is a special kind called a "property" and is one of the places where the ontology lives - there are
specific rules for each property on how it should be used in a relationship, like what's allowed to be the subject and
what's allowed to be the object. For"instance of", there are no rules about the subject. However, the object of the
relationship where "instance of" is the property should be a "class" of thing. It wouldn't make sense for the type of
another entity to be an instance of "Albert Einstein".

### Ontology for Organizations

When making a Wikidata page for an organization, it should have a type of either
[organization](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43229) or one of its subclasses representing various kinds of
organizations, parts of organizations, or combinations of subclasses and parts. Some examples are:

- [research institute](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q31855) like
  the [Fraunhofer SCAI](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1451981)
- [department](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2366457)
  like [Fraunhofer SCAI Department of Bioinformatics](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q67200492)
- [university](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3918) like [Northeastern University](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37548)
- [faculty](Q180958) like
  the [Maastricht Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q48888910)
- [academic department](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2467461)
  like [Maastricht University Department of Bioinformatics (BiGCaT)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19845644)
- [business](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4830453) like [Pfizer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q206921)

Typically, organizations have certain pieces of information associated with them using the following properties:

- [short name](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1813) - is there a short version of your organization's name?
  BiGCaT is again a good example.
- [country](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P17) - in which country is your organization based? Wikidata already
  has items for countries, so the autocomplete will help you fill out this very easily.
- [official website](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P856) - what is the URL of the homepage for your
  organization?
- [part of](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P361) and [has part](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P527) -
  what are the parent organzation(s) and child organizations? If your item is a department, it is likely "part of" a
  school, faculty, college, university, or research institution. It's best to be as specific as possible. If you are
  describing a department that is part of a faculty in a university (see the BiGCaT example above), it doesn't make
  sense to be redundant and also write that it is a part of the University.

Leadership and organizer links:

- [chairperson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P488) - who is the leader of the organization? This person should
  themselves have a Wikidata page. For a department, this is equivalent to the department chair/head.
- [chief executive officer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P169) - who is the CEO of a business?
- [founded by](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P112) - who founded a business?

External Account Links:

- [Twitter username](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P2002)
- [LinkedIn company ID](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P4264)
- [GitHub username](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P2037)

### Tutorial

1. Create a [new item](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:NewItem). You don't need to have a Wikidata account or be
   logged in, but there are lots of benefits, so that's highly suggested through
   [this portal](https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&returnto=Wikidata%3AMain+Page).
2. Input the name for the item. If you're making a page for the Northeastern Department of Chemistry, it makes most
   sense to include the name of the parent organization inside the label for the item. There are some instances where
   this isn't the case, such as the example above of the Maastricht Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, but
   this could cause confusion. The rest of the form is pretty obvious, but if you aren't sure what to entry for the
   description, writing what kind of thing it is might be best. For the Northeastern Department of Chemistry, one might
   write "academic department"
   ![Wikidata create item page](/img/wikidata_create_item.png)
3. You'll see a mostly blank page. Start by clicking the  "+ add statement" link in the middle to bring up the following
   box. On the left where "Property" is greyed out, you can type the name of the relationship and click the right
   suggestion from the dropdown
   ![Wikidata add statement step 1](/img/wikidata_add_statement_1.png)
4. In the middle, you can type the object of the relationship. If the property accepts another Wikidata item, it will
   show an autocomplete field. If the property accepts a scalar (like an identifier), then no dropdown will pop up.
   ![Wikidata add statement step 2](/img/wikidata_add_statement_2.png)
5. After checking what you've typed is correct, click publish! Don't worry, all items can be edited/updated later.
   ![Wikidata add statement step 3](/img/wikidata_add_statement_3.png)
6. Repeat for all information you know about the organization. It's a bit high-minded, but you can also follow the links
   for the properties mentioned above to see the rules they define for how they should be used. The cool thing about
   ontologies is that properties can actually be the subject of relationships that describe how they work using
   "meta-properties" ðŸ¤¯.

bottom of this post) or make a PR to this page directly on GitHub!

## Step 2: Research Organization Registry

The [Research Organization Registry (ROR)](https://ror.org) is an organization dedicated to assigning unique identifiers
to all research organizations. Definitely check out their homepage, I couldn't write it any better than they did. They
can accomplish the same goal that you can on Wikidata, but there's a clear advantage towards having nomenclature
authorities that manually curate and maintain data.

Their [curation page](https://ror.org/curation/) has a link to their request form where you can send information about
your organization to them. Even better, they accept Wikidata identifiers, so you don't have to type everything all over
again! I personally filled out the form and had some very nice email exchanges later with their team, so I hope you have
a nice experience too. Eventually, they will assign your organization a ROR identifier as well as curate relationships
between your organization and others.

Finally, the whole loop that started with Wikidata can be closed by copying your newly minted ROR identifier back to
your organization's Wikidata item. Wikidata has a property [ROR ID](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P6782) whose
object is the scalar identifier from ROR!

## Step 3: Optional but Cool Things

Wikidata, ROR, and GRID (below) are by far the best solutions for storing scholarly metadata because of their licensing
and API accessibility. Ringgold and ISNI are not good options for building a reusable infrastructure since they are both
closed and paid systems, but they are still relevant (until the revolution) for some aspects of modern scientific
publication.

### Global Research Identifier Database

The [Global Research Identifier Database (GRID)](https://grid.ac/) is a parallel effort that imports data from ROR on a
quarterly (every three months) basis. It assigns an additional GRID identifier to an organization that is already in
ROR. GRID is released about every three months via FigShare under
the [Creative Commons Public Domain 1.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/),
which means anyone can use it any way they want.

Like with ROR, GRID has a Wikidata property [GRID ID](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P2427) that links a
Wikidata item to the scalar GRID identifier.

**August 10, 2021 update**: GRID is shutting down and getting consumed by ROR
([ref](https://www.digital-science.com/grid-passes-the-torch-to-ror-faqs/)).

### Ringgold and ISNI

Many publishers use the Ringgold system for organization resolution (such as Manuscript Central). For a group interested
in scholarly publishing (which could either be an academic or commercial organization), you can simultaneously apply for
a Ringgold and ISNI by emailing isni@ringgold.com (copied from their [FAQ](https://www.ringgold.com/isni/)).

These can be linked to a Wikidata item with the [Ringgold ID](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P3500) and
[ISNI](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P213) properties.

### Scholia

Once your Wikidata page is full of information, you can use [Scholia](https://scholia.toolforge.org/) to visualize all
the information attached to your organization through Wikidata. For example, see the
[University of Cambridge](https://scholia.toolforge.org/organization/Q35794). To get the most of this, you should
annotate for each member of your organization that they are affiliated, have been educated at, or have been employed at
your organization, whether it's current or past - Wikidata has additional metadata for a relationship for representing
the time period during which it was true.

---

Scholia shows off how easy it is to build a system on top of the data in Wikidata and the (free!) SPARQL infrastructure
they provide for accessing the data however you want. This is the original reason for me bringing up Wikidata in the
Manubot issue tracker. It would be totally reasonable to hit their SPARQL endpoint with one query per Manubot build and
continue being good open source citizens.

This blog post might have gone off on a couple tangents besides what was relevant for Manubot, but because I did all of
these things to set up the internet presence of my previous employer, it could serve as a good guide for any new
organizations to get up to speed.
