In a [previous post]({% post_url 2021-01-17-organization-organization %}), I described how to formalize the information
about a research organization using Wikidata. This post follows the same theme, but about this time about a given
researcher. Not only can you follow this post to make your own scientific profile easier to find and navigate, but you
can also use Wikidata to improve the profiles of your co-workers and collaborators.

There are several _other_ places besides Wikidata for putting your scholarly profile. The first (and worst) is by making
a resume in an awful Word document or PDF. Much like what ends up in english prose in scientific texts, this is where
knowledge goes to die. The next less bad is to put it in a closed repository like LinkedIn, ResearchGate, or Scopus.
These might be nice, but don't forget they're companies and do not want people to be able to use their troves without
paying up. The runner-up is ORCID, which is absolutely amazing for providing persistent identifiers to individuals,
linking published work in high-profile repositories like PubMed, and in some cases linking grants. While it will be the
cornerstone of this tutorial, it ultimately falls short as a tool for integrating the wide variety of information
available about any given researcher. So who's the winner? Wikidata, of course! It has an incredible flexibility for
creating new relationships and a first-class notion of scholarly works, awards, affiliations, employers, and the
relationships between them that make it a perfect place for storing information.

Anyone can edit Wikidata, meaning you can create an entry for your curmudgeonly PI who wouldn't be caught dead making a
profile on this new thing called "the internet". Even better, there are several people in the bibliometrics community
who have created bots for importing and aligning information from external sources that make the entries that you supply
so much more rich overnight (e.g., some bots automatically translate the descriptions of pages into new languages, some
import publication metadata, some align identifiers with external resources).
