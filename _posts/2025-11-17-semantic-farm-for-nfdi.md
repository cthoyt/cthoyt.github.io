The Semantic Farm (https://semantic.farm) is a data interoperability platform
that indexes ontologies, databases, and other resources that assign (persistent)
identifiers.

By collecting metadata about such resources, the Semantic Farm supports
researchers to find the appropriate (persistent) identifier schema to annotate
their (meta)data to be more FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable,
reusable).

The NFDI
[Section (Meta)data, Terminologies, Provenance](https://www.nfdi.de/section-meta/?lang=en)
proposes the Semantic Farm as a
[Basic Service for NFDI (Base4NFDI)](https://base4nfdi.de)

Why should it be a Base4NFDI service?

Who are the stakeholders?

1. NFDI Sections
   - [Section Common Infrastructure](https://www.nfdi.de/section-infra/?lang=en)
     - Data Integration
     - Data Management Planning
     - Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
     - Electronic Lab Notebooks
     - Persistent Identifiers (PID)
   - Section Metadata's charter said to do a survey of consortia ontology
     usage - this is a place to concretize it and make actionable
   - Section EduTrain uses Semantic Farm in the DALIA project to make OERs
     citable
2. NFDI Consortia
   - Chemistry and Cat did pilot where they consolidated all the ontologies they
     use. This helps them communicate to all scientist in the consortia
   - Culture demonstrated w/ my blog post
   - Need to reach out to other sections...
3. Base4NFDI
   - TS4NFDI technologies use Semantic Farm in the core already (e.g., ontology
     lookup service) in their implementation for supporting cross-references.
     There are also several ideas for incubators to more tightly integrate
     Semantic Farm into TS4NFDI to better support TS4NFDI users. Semantic Farm
   - DMP4NFDI can use Semantic Farm to support writing better data management
     plans by 1. helping find appropriate ontologies, controlled vocabularies,
     and other resources that mint semantic spaces to annotate data in a FAIR
     way and 2. educating writers to understand some practical aspects of
     semantics
   - PID4NFDI - need to show how it's complementary and how it's different
   - KGI4NFDI
4. NFDI Central
   - Reporting on semantic spaces produced by consortia, which includes both
     ontologies and databases. By construction, anything in Semantic Farm has
     taken a significant step towards FAIR by documenting its accessibility,
     improving its findability, and implicitly by making info necessary for
     interoperability

Difference from previous base4nfdi proposals:

1. Semantic Farm already exists, is already running, and is already being
   demonstrated.
2. We started with Bioregistry, and the idea is to support whole NFDI
3. Doesn't need a ton of funding to continue, already has a detailed governacne
   strucutre to support community maintenance which leads to sustainability and
   longevity
4. Has international partners outside NFDI / europe that are invested in it.
