Writing excellent documentation is crucial for open source software projects. It's also a *lot* of
hard work. I consider tools like [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) combine with services
like [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) completely invaluable, but I've recently hit a
roadblock when it comes to making the README of a GitHub repository a bit more dynamic. This blog
post is about the dark magic I invented to support this.

This journey will be framed through my work on the documentation of
[PyKEEN](https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/), a machine learning library for learning low-dimensional
embeddings for nodes and edges in knowledge graphs. In this blog post, you don't need to understand
anything about the package itself other than it has several types of interchangable components
that can be combined to create a "model" that gets trained on a dataset. In the documentation,
I used the [`sphinx-automodapi`](https://sphinx-automodapi.readthedocs.io) extension to generate
pretty lists of all the datasets, models, loss functions, regularizers, etc.
