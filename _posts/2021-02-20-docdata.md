Writing excellent documentation is crucial for open source software projects. It's also a *lot* of
hard work. While I consider tools like [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) combine with services
like [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) completely invaluable, I've recently hit a bit of a
roadblock when it comes to making the README of a GitHub repository a bit more dynamic. This blog
post is about the dark magic I invented as a solution (i.e., the [`docdata`](https://github.
com/cthoyt/docdata/) package).

Before beginning, I want to give a quick refresher on what documentation looks like in Python. For
any class or object, you can write a docstring using triple-double quotes on the first line after
the definition

```python
def sin(x):
    """Compute the sin of x."""
    ...


class MyClass:
    """This is my class."""
    ...
```

Not only are docstrings useful for readers of your code, but Python considers them with great
respect. [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257) outlines in full detail, but the
important thing to keep in mind is that Python code can introspect on the docstring for any
function, class, etc. with the special `__doc__` attribute (e.g., `MyClass.__doc__` stores the
docstring itself). This feature is what enables tools like Sphinx to exist without having to write
an entirely new parser for Python files.

The rest of this journey will be told through the perspective of my work on the documentation of
[PyKEEN](https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/), a machine learning library for learning low-dimensional
embeddings for nodes and edges in knowledge graphs. In this blog post, you don't need to understand
anything about the package itself other than it has several types of interchangable components that
can be combined to create a *model* that gets trained on a *dataset*. Its documentation uses the
[`sphinx-automodapi`](https://sphinx-automodapi.readthedocs.io) extension to generate pretty lists
of all the datasets, models, loss functions, regularizers, etc.
([example](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/regularizers.html)).

The problem is that most people start to use a given package by either looking at the README file in
the GitHub repository, or the splash text on the PyPI project page (which, for PyKEEN and most
packages, is created with the README on upload). I wanted to generate beautiful tables describing
the components on the README file the same as in the Sphinx documentation, so I started by writing a
template markdown file using [`jinja`](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) as a templating language.
For each type of component, I programatically built a table, formatted it as markdown
with [`tabulate`](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/), and formatted it into the template.

The tricky part was making these tables better than just lists of the names of the classes. Sphinx
has a deep integration with the restructured text (RST) format and provides custom "directives"
like `:class:` that allow for automatic linking between documentation for modules, classes,
functions, variables, or anything else. Luckily, the
`sphinx-automodapi` uses a standard format for its documentation. For example,
the [`pykeen.models.ComplEx`](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pykeen.models.ComplEx.html)
class gets built with a URL
like [https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pykeen.models.ComplEx.html](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pykeen.models.ComplEx.html).
The general form for `<X>` is `https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/<X>.html`. I was able
to take advantage of this and generate a column with the name of the class in PyKEEN with a link to
the documentation for the class on ReadTheDocs. This also gives insight to users who might want to
import these classes themselves.

The next tricky part was providing some context besides just the name and class name. For new users
looking at the models in PyKEEN, it's also useful to show a citation. This typically includes the
first author's last name and the year as in "Ali *et al.*, 2019". Additionally, the citation should
link to the paper itself for further reading past what the PyKEEN documentation for the model
provides. As an aside, it's one of my personal goals for PyKEEN's documentation to be an educational
resource that in many cases will be more useful than reading manuscripts written by computer
scientists, whose goals are to make themselves smart more than to motivate and educate the reader.
In RST, there's
a [syntax](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#citations) for linking
citations that the PyKEEN documentation organizes in
a [documentation-wide bibliography](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/references.html).
Unfortunately, my templating system is not as powerful as Sphinx, and does not parse all of these
files. The solution I had was to standardize the citation keys and the format of the first line of
each model's docstring such that the name and year could be extracted with some simple text
processing because I enforced the standard that all model docstrings ended with the RST citation.

```python
from pykeen.models import ComplEx

doc = ComplEx.__doc__
doc_lines = doc.splitlines()
line = doc_lines[0]  # get the first line of the docstring
l, r = line.find('['), line.find(']')
author, year = line[1 + l: r - 4], line[r - 4: r] 
```

Then the author and year could be formatted into a new column in the previous format. However,
programatically getting the citation link was a completely different problem. One solution I
considered was to start adding class variables with this information, but that would quickly become
a distraction to users.

Then, I remembered a cool feature of [`flasgger`](https://github.com/flasgger/flasgger/), which
automatically generates a Swagger interface for Flask applications by embedding the Swagger
definition as YAML inside
each [route's docstring](https://github.com/flasgger/flasgger/#using-docstrings-as-specification). I
didn't look into their code for an implementation and tried it my own with some pretty fast success!
The simple (but robust) code that I wrote for PyKEEN seemed generally useful, so I moved it into its
own package [`docdata`](https://github.com/cthoyt/docdata/) - so others could easily use it. It went
very fast because I recently put a lot of effort into creating
a [Cookiecutter package](https://github.com/cthoyt/cookiecutter-python-package)
with all of my favorite settings that I've covered in previous posts on this blog.

It does the same thing as `flasgger` - it allows the final few lines following a delimiter string
(i.e., `---`) of a docstring to be parsed as YAML and stored in the object. It can be applied as a
decorator to functions and classes, or simply to any data or Python object that has a docstring. A
demonstration shows it all:

```python
from docdata import parse_docdata, get_docdata


@parse_docdata
class MyClass:
    """This is my class.

    ---
    author: Charlie
    motto:
    - docs
    - are
    - cool
    """


assert {'author': 'Charlie', 'motto': ['docs', 'are', 'cool']} == get_docdata(MyClass)
```

The data can also be accessed directly via `MyClass.__docdata__` but dunders are scary, and I
thought it would be nice to have a getter as well.

This was immediately useful for PyKEEN models because I was able to store all the citation
information in a structured way at the bottom of the docstring. Then, I was able to improve my table
generator to make a much more rich column for citations that included the link to each. I also did
something for datasets in PyKEEN, but additionally included statistics about each dataset's
entities, relations, and triples to make the PyKEEN README even more useful. The full pull request
on PyKEEN can be found at [pykeen/pykeen!303](https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/pull/303).
