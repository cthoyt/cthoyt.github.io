title: "Host a Graduate Seminar Before Writing Your Thesis"
date: 2020-02-09 00:00:00 -0800
---
The other day I saw a tweet lamenting the drag that is literature
review during preparation for writing your thesis.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I just love writing 15 page literature reviews for graduate school courses on literally any topic except my thesis topic.</p>&mdash; PhD Diaries (@thoughtsofaphd) <a href="https://twitter.com/thoughtsofaphd/status/1225762592045649920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2020</a></blockquote>

I agree. I felt the same pain last fall when I wrote [my doctoral thesis](https://github.com/cthoyt/doctoral-thesis). 
Luckily, I had a strategy that made it a bit easier.

I learned it from one of my professors when I was doing my master's degree
in Life Science Informatics. Each semester, we had a seminar course in which
each student was assigned research articles to read and present to the class
with a short slide deck. Later, I joined his research group and realized that
this course served as a literature review for him just as much as us.

So later when I was a Ph.D. student, I volunteered to run the seminar. I
co-opted the concept, and planned the course to cover many of the topics I
found interesting for my thesis. I already knew some of the papers very well,
and a few were ones I had always been meaning to read. I tried to pick the most
recent papers for topics when possible, but also threw in a few classics as
well.

On the first day of the seminar, I shared the following course information. I
thought it was important to make clear what my expectations were for students
in terms of their prior knowledge. Since they all came from the same master's
program, I thought it was enough that they had passed one of the first semester
lectures called "Biological Databases" which was about many of the resources
and databases used in the systems and networks biology community. I also
outlined what was the content for the course, what was expected, etc. then
shared this all as a Google Doc so they could read it over and add comments.

I also made a list of possible papers and a tentative schedule that students
could look over and decide which papers they found most interesting. The
topics were arranged in a logical order to tell the story of my thesis, and
for each section there were a few papers that I thought were very important,
and a few extras just in case there was a lot of interest. During the first
day of the seminar, I also went through the list of all papers and explained
the topics to the students. I gave them this list via Google Docs as well, and
they were able to claim papers for their presentations. Below, I've listed the
final list of papers and the order in which they were presented. We were able
to come to agreements for all students to present the papers I found most
important. Maybe 40% of the class found a paper interesting and picked one the
first day and the rest took the next week to decide, ask questions, or propose
new papers.

Another consideration I had when picking this paper list was to choose
work done by my colleagues that I found interesting and helpful. After, I
invited them to come listen to the seminar and mediate discussion after.
We were able to invite one of my collaborators Mehdi Ali (he's a really good
guy!) to discuss his work on using deep learning for relation extraction in
natural language processing. I think that might have been the most engaging
day of the whole series.

I added one aspect to this course compared to the previous seminar that I had
attended: each student was not only responsible for presenting the paper that
had been assigned from my list, but they were also responsible for finding a
relevant pre-print (in the same or similar topic) and submitting a peer review
through the pre-print system. When I was a student, I noticed many students did
not read the references of the paper they were assigned in our seminars, and
also had not considered other similar research to their paper. Asking them to
find their own papers was a way to make this a more creative and fun process,
and would directly prepare them to answer questions at the end of the
presentation like "what will the authors do next?" or "how will this research
be used by others?"

One of the funny things that happened during the pre-print presentations is
the students found several of mine and presented those. I suppose this was
inevitable given the contemporary nature of my work in the context of the
topics chosen. I would actually explicitly encourage students to check out my
pre-prints the next time I host a seminar, because I know the work very well
and could mediate a nice discussion.

I learned a lot through the process of preparing this seminar. Its outline
became the outline for my thesis, and a lot of the discussions
became points that I addressed explicitly in my writing. I wouldn't say that
I was taking advantage of the students in this process - we all benefited from
the experience. I hope you get some ideas about how you might be able to do
this yourself, whether you're a doctoral student, a postdoc, or something else!

## Course Information

- Title: Knowledge Assembly, Data Integration, and Modeling in Systems and Networks Biology
- Period: Winter Semester 2018/2019
- Location: Endenicher Allee 19A, Room U.105 on Wednesdays 13.00-14.30

### Qualifications

Students should be comfortable with the material presented in the Biological
Databases lecture during the first semester of the LSI curriculum.

### Goal

Students will have the opportunity to practice reading, presenting, and
discussing recent biomedical literature on the topics of knowledge assembly,
data integration, and modeling in systems and networks biology. 

### Content

Students will be assigned papers and present on the holistic process of
knowledge discovery in systems and networks biology that focus on the topics of
knowledge assembly (e.g., natural language processing, modeling formalisms and
formats, reasoning techniques), data integration (e.g., practical scenarios
focusing on techniques on the data level, knowledge level, and analytical
levels), and modeling strategies (e.g., rule-based modeling, agent-based modeling,
mathematical modeling, hypothesis generation with knowledge-based approaches).

### Assignment

Students will be assigned an article to read and present during a thirty (30)
minute lecture. One goal of this lecture is to show an understanding of not
only the material presented in the article, but also the relevant background
information - this may entail following the references and reading other
articles. Another goal is to not only educate, but entertain the audience.
Students will also be expected to find a relevant pre-print article on arXiv,
bioRxiv, or other pre-print server and post a peer-review for the author on
the corresponding service. Following the presentation of their assigned
article, students should include slides (1-3) briefly explaining the relevance
of the pre-print that they found.

## Method of Performance Review

Students will be assessed on the understanding of their assigned topic, the
quality of their presentation, and their participation. Students missing more
than 2 seminars will not pass the course without a doctor's note.
