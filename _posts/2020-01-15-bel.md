This post gives a brief introduction to Biological Expression
Language (BEL), which is one format for this. Its purpose is to encode
qualitative causal, correlative, and associative relations between
biological entities across multiple scales.

A BEL statement (D) is encoded as a triplet containing a subject, a
predicate, and an object. The predicate can represents the type of
relation while the subject and object can either represent the
abundance of molecular entities such as genes, proteins, chemicals,
or more abstract concepts such as biochemical reactions, biological
processes, and pathologies. Identifiers for these concepts use
references to external namespaces to qualify their respective names.
In this example, [ChEBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/) is used to
qualify chemicals and [MeSH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh) for
biological processes.

BEL statements are organized into BEL Scripts, which track provenance
information like namespace references, relation provenance (e.g. citation,
evidence), and biological context-specific relation metadata
(e.g. anatomy, cell, disease).

BEL Script, which contains three sections: A) the document metadata
section provides provenance information such as the name, version,
and author; B) the definitions section provides references to
external resources that are used as identifiers and metadata in the
relations section; and C) the relations section contains BEL
relations and their metadata: minimally including a citation and
evidence with the possibility to include additional information such
as biological context (e.g. cell, anatomy, disease).

Because the object of one BEL statement can be the subject of another,
BEL can be compiled into networks that describe chains of causation.
Often, the terms “BEL”, “BEL Script”, and “BEL Networks” are used
interchangeably.

If you’re interested in learning more, see the OpenBEL website. BEL
can be programmatically read by [PyBEL](https://github.com/pybel/pybel)
or used interactively with [BEL Commons](https://bel-commons.scai.fraunhofer.de)
to search networks and run analyses.
