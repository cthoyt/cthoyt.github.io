!! it just occurred to me that the 2026 organizers have again done an absolutely diabolical anti-pattern. They are
requiring registration at abstract submission time. This is absolutely not cool and every hates this. We really need to
add into our ISB conference guidelines that this should not not not be done
6:55
More importantly than everyone hates this, it confuses the heck out of people who are hoping to submit an abstract so
they're eligible for the travel grant, since it requires them to pay up front.We got an email from Nkimdeng Desmond
Akumtoh about this, so it's not just an abstract concern

3. The ISB would have discretion to accept such abstracts on behalf of the conference scientific programming committee
   OR we would require at least one person from the conference SPC to participate in award meetings/discussions so this
   information could be synced together
2. Stop stop stop creating registration/abstract submission workflows like this. Yes, we get that the point is to get
   people to register/pay sooner. But it freaks everyone out, which makes the whole conference a categorically worse
   experience
