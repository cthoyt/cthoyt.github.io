While we were recently preparing to submit a manuscript, the lead author said
they looked at my last few papers and noticed I always used a private email
address instead of an institutional email address. They asked, perplexed, if
they should also use my private email address with our submission. The answer
was a resounding *yes*; always use a private email address. Here's why.

## You Can't Take It With You

If you're a researcher who sometimes writes and submits publications, the
chances are pretty high that you currently work at some kind of institution and
will not always work at that institution. Here's what might happen to your
institutional email address when you leave:

1. Your old institution doesn't care about you after you leave, and deletes your
   account the moment you walk out the door.
2. Your old institution doesn't care about you after you leave, and says that
   they will continue your access for a limited amount of time after you leave
   to save face. Then it deletes your account.
3. Your old institution doesn't care about you after you leave, and says that
   they will continue to provide technical support to you and all previous
   employees indefinitely with their infinite money and benevolence. I'm being
   sarcastic; this is really, really unlikely.

Whether 1, 2, or 3, if you used your institutional email address on a paper you
published, it is now a dead link into the abyss. Anyone who might want to get in
touch with you to chat about your research (or god forbid, ask you for code or
data that you didn't deposit in an appropriate place before publishing).

If you had used your personal email address, which won't go away, then you
wouldn't have this problem.

Alternatively, some publishers allow you to annotate your ORCID identifier on to
the manuscript, then you could potentially maintain your current working email
address through ORCID, but again, not a lot of publishers support this (yet).

## Using your institutional email is institutional policy

Institutions obviously want as much attribution as possible when you publish
while working there, and using a prominent email address is one way to get that
goal. Therefore, many institutions have a policy that you have to use your
institutional email when publishing. One possibility is to simply disregard this
policy if there are no huge bureaucratic processes that check papers carefully.
Policies can be wrong. Have you read the news lately?

## I'm worried about getting a bunch of spam

I can't speak for all situations, but I've been using my personal gmail address
all over the internet and still haven't got a ton of spam. It's sitting at the
bottom of this blog post if you want to prove me wrong. If you're worried about
this, make a new private email account you just use for publishing.

## What does Twitter think?

Like many of my posts, this one started with a conversation on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lesson for young researchers - don’t use your institutional email address on papers.<br><br>You *will* leave, you won’t get to keep it, and you’ll miss out on lots of people who want to talk to you because of the interesting work you did.<br><br>Try <a href="https://twitter.com/ORCID_Org?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ORCID_Org</a> instead :) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AcademicChatter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AcademicChatter</a></p>&mdash; Charles Tapley Hoyt (@cthoyt) <a href="https://twitter.com/cthoyt/status/1275566074902335490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2020</a></blockquote>
