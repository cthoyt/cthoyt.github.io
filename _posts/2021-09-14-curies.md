Compact uniform resource identifiers, or CURIEs, are an important formalism for
referencing biomedical entities.

In the semantic web and ontology communities, uniform resource identifiers
(URIs) are used to identify named entities. For a given nomenclature, like
the [Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi),
URIs usually have two parts, which will be demonstrated below for
[alsterpaullone](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:138488).
First, in red, is the URL prefix. The second, in orange, is the local identifier
of the entity.

<span style="color:red">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:</span><span
style="color:orange">138488</span>
