Compact uniform resource identifiers, or CURIEs, are an important formalism for
referencing biomedical entities. This post explains what they are, how to write
them yourself, and a brief outline of how they fit in to the semantic web,
linked open data, and open biomedical ontology worlds.

In the semantic web, linked open data, and ontology communities, uniform
resource identifiers (URIs) are used to reference named entities. For a given
nomenclature, like the
[Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi),
URIs usually have two parts:

1. A URI prefix (in red)
2. A unique local identifier from the given nomenclature (in orange)

All the URIs from the same nomenclature will have the same URI prefix, but a
different unique local identifier. Here's an example, using the ChEBI unique
local identifier for
[alsterpaullone](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:138488):

<span style="color:red">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=</span><span
style="color:orange">138488</span>

## The Trouble with URIs

URIs are inconvenient because each named entity could be referenced by
potentially many URIs. For example, a URI could start with either `http` or
`https`. Even worse, there are several competing services that each try to mint
the _one true URI_ for each. XKCD sums the ensuing chaos up pretty well:

</a>

For the example molecule, alsterpaullone, here are some (but not all) of the
possible URIs that could be used to reference it:

| Provider         | URI                                                                                                                                                        |

The real issue with URIs is that the URI prefix (the beginning part) doesn't
really tell you anything. In fact, given a URI, you usually have to do some
detective work to figure out which nomenclature authority it goes with.

One solution was to use resolvers that create "persistent URLs", but in the end,
there are many competing resolvers that don't cover everything. For example, the
OBO PURL system doesn't cover HGNC and UniProt. The Identifiers.org system
doesn't cover many ontologies.

For practical purposes, it makes sense to keep track of the commonly used names
of each resource, then just generate the kinds of URIs that people might want
depending on what software or data systems they're working with rather than
prescribing one URI to be the canonical one.

## Come to the Dark Side, We have CURIEs

The solution is to use compact uniform resource identifiers (CURIEs), which
replace the URI prefix with a more approachable prefix. A CURIE has three parts:

1. A prefix (in red)
2. A delimiter (in black)
3. A unique local identifier from the given nomenclature (in orange)

Since everyone agrees on what ChEBI is, it makes sense to use `chebi` as the
prefix for ChEBI unique local identifiers. Here's the same example for
alsterpaullone, condensed as a CURIE:

<span style="color:red">chebi</span><b>:</b><span style="color:orange">138488</span>

The best part of a CURIE is that you can associate your favorite URI prefix with
its corresponding prefix depending on your use case. You can even have a
database that stores all of the possible ones for you. Replacing URIs with
prefixes is so common, that it's a core part of the SPARQL query language, which
is used both in the semantic web and ontologies to traverse data stored in the
resource description framework (RDF) schema. Here's an example SPARQL query that
has these prefixes prominently at the top:

```sparql
prefix obo: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/>
prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?x ?p ?y
WHERE {
  {?x rdfs:subClassOf [
    a owl:Restriction ;
    owl:onProperty ?p ;
    owl:someValuesFrom ?y ]
  }
  UNION {
   ?x rdfs:subClassOf ?y .
   BIND(rdfs:subClassOf AS ?p)
  }
  ?x a owl:Class .
  ?y a owl:Class .
}
```

This example was borrowed from the SPARQL queries in the repository for the
[Core Ontology for Biology and Biomedicine (COB)](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/COB/blob/master/src/sparql/edges.sparql).
You don't have to understand the SPARQL itself, just check the first 4 lines
that start with `prefix ...`.

### How to Build a CURIE

Most common vocabularies can be written as CURIEs. Here are a few examples:

| Name                     | Prefix  | Example Unique Local Identifier | Example CURIE  |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Gene Ontology            | go      | 0032571                         | go:0032571     |
| HGNC                     | hgnc    | 16793                           | hgnc:16793     |
| UniProt                  | uniprot | P0DP23                          | uniprot:P0DP23 |
| Disease Ontology         | doid    | 0110974                         | doid:0110974   |
| Medical Subject Headings | mesh    | C063233                         | mesh:C063233   |

As you might guess, most prefixes are either the acronym for a nomenclature
authority or the name itself. There are a few cases where this isn't true, like
for Disease Ontology. Their acronym is DO, but then that add ID which is usually
shorthand for "identifier", and therefore get `doid` as a prefix.

Just to reiterate, it's really easy to make a CURIE. You take the prefix, a
colon, then the unique local identifier and smash them together! Note: some
communities, like the Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry, like to stylize
prefixes with uppercase or mixed-case. If you live in URI world, this is a big
deal, but for most practical purposes, it's nice to be able to just keep it all
lowercase.

How do you know what's the right prefix for each resource? And who even keeps
track of this stuff? The [Bioregistry](https://bioregistry.io/) keeps an
up-to-date list that you can browse or search
[here](https://bioregistry.io/registry/). My team at Harvard Medical School has
been building this with help from the community to serve the community needs
that previous registries didn't - most importantly, to make the data open and
transparent and to enable community suggestions in an open and fair way.
