title: You Should Use a Private Email on Publications

While we were recently preparing to submit a manuscript, the lead author said
they looked at my last few papers and noticed I always used a private email
address instead of an institutional email address. They asked, perplexed, if
they should also use my private email address with our submission. The answer
was a resounding *yes*; always use a private email address. Here's why.

I actually started thinking about this way back one thousand years ago in 2020
and started an interesting discussion on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lesson for young researchers - don’t use your institutional email address on papers.<br><br>You *will* leave, you won’t get to keep it, and you’ll miss out on lots of people who want to talk to you because of the interesting work you did.<br><br>Try <a href="https://twitter.com/ORCID_Org?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ORCID_Org</a> instead :) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AcademicChatter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AcademicChatter</a></p>&mdash; Charles Tapley Hoyt (@cthoyt) <a href="https://twitter.com/cthoyt/status/1275566074902335490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2020</a></blockquote>

I came back to this again when submitting
the [Gilda](https://github.com/indralab/gilda) manuscript at the end of 2021,
then got a distracted by an ankle injury and sort of lost track of all the blog
posts I had been writing. Now I'm finishing it up in early February 2022. The
rest of this post is an elaboration on my ideas and follow-up discussion on
Twitter.

## You can't take it with you

If you're a researcher who sometimes writes and submits publications, the
chances are pretty high that you currently work at some kind of institution and
will not always work at that institution. Here's what might happen to your
institutional email address when you leave:

1. Your old institution doesn't care about you after you leave, and deletes your
   account the moment you walk out the door.
2. Your old institution doesn't care about you after you leave, and says that
   they will continue your access for a limited amount of time after you leave
   to save face. Then it deletes your account.
3. Your old institution doesn't care about you after you leave, and says that
   they will continue to provide technical support to you and all previous
   employees indefinitely with their infinite money and benevolence. I'm being
   sarcastic; this is really, really unlikely.

Whether 1, 2, or 3, if you used your institutional email address on a paper you
published, it is now a dead link into the abyss. Anyone who might want to get in
touch with you to chat about your research (or god forbid, ask you for code or
data that you didn't deposit in an appropriate place before publishing).

If you had used your personal email address, which won't go away, then you
wouldn't have this problem.

Alternatively, some publishers allow you to annotate your ORCID identifier on to
the manuscript, then you could potentially maintain your current working email
address through ORCID, but again, not a lot of publishers support this (yet).

## Who does this most affect?

As you become more senior, the chances of you moving institutions decreases. So
this is an issue that disproportionately affects young researchers twice:
first because you are harder to reach and second because your ability to network
is more crucial as a young researcher than to an veteran one.

## Do your best to disregard institutional policy

Institutions obviously want as much attribution as possible when you publish
while working there, and using a prominent email address is one way to get that
goal. Therefore, many institutions have a policy that you have to use your
institutional email when publishing. A few courses of actions you could take:

1. Ask the editor to include multiple email addresses
2. Disregard institutional policy, it doesn't support you as a researcher or a
   person.

## I'm worried about getting a bunch of spam

I can't speak for all situations, but I've been using my personal gmail address
all over the internet and still haven't got a ton of spam. It's sitting at the
bottom of this blog post if you want to prove me wrong. If you're worried about
this, make a new private email account you just use for publishing.

## Difficulties for editors

One [follow-up conversation](https://twitter.com/JohnRYatesIII/status/1275791480234237954?s=20&t=9tkF3mhrQ12uXaP3e7G_uA)
I had on Twitter was with John R. Yates III, the editor-in-chief of
the [Journal of Proteome Research](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/jprobs). He gave
interesting insight that editors highly prefer institutional email addresses
because they are perceived to be more trustworthy. There are several reasons why
this is not true (e.g., you could use an outdated address, spoof it, etc.) but
ultimately this serves to distract from adopting more sustainable ways of
identifying authors and reviewers like with ORCID.
