I've been thinking about how to make the development and maintenance of the [Bioregistry](https://bioregistry.io)
sustainable since its first public showcase at
the [Workshop on Prefixes, CURIEs, and IRIs](https://biopragmatics.github.io/workshops/WPCI2021.html)
in 2021, where a lot of discussion gravitated towards the question of funding.
Since then, we have tried to mitigate the need for ongoing funding by applying
the [Open Code, Open Data, and Open Infrastructure (O3) Guidelines](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/vuzt3).
Despite our successful operationalization of this progressive philosophy, funding still remains an important
part of any discussion about sustainability. I wrote about some ideas for the Bioregistry in a
[previous post](https://cthoyt.com/2023/01/04/small-website-grant-idea.html).
This (living) post contains more general ideas about where to look for direct funding for small, fundamental curated
resources.

## Funding Bodies

### Alfred P. Sloan Foundation

The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation is a not-for-profit institution that focuses on grants for scientific research.

They have a rolling grant process that begins with a proactive letter of inquiry.
Additionally, they periodically list [open calls](https://sloan.org/grants/open-calls) for funding, which might
sometimes be relevant.

### Chan Zuckerberg Iniative (CZI)

### [Code for Science and Society](https://www.codeforsociety.org)

Fiscal sponsorship

- national PID policies -> another place where bioregistry could be helpful

Elixir interoperability platform / elixir in germany:

- GErman Netowrk for Bioinformatics infrastructure: https://www.denbi.de/elixir-de

We have also had the good fortune to enter discussions with
the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)](https://chanzuckerberg.com) that lead to a generous grant to support the project.
