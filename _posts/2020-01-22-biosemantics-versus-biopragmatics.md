In language, semantics describe the names and meanings of words. The
bioinformatics community has aptly adopted _biosemantics_ as a concept that
encompasses the issues with the names and meanings of biological entities,
usually in natural language processing and data integration. However, semantics
does not capture the context of words, and _biosemantics_ fails to describe the
biological context and complex relationships between biological entities.

Pragmatics goes beyond semantics and describes the context of words. Because of
this parallelism, I've begun to use the term _biopragmatics_ to describe the
family of computational approaches aimed at identifying and contextualizing the
context of biological entities.
