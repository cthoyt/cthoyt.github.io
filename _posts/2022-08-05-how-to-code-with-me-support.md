Make a new thread if it's not related to the previous discussion

Give proper background so whoever is reading about your issue can understand it.
This includes writing out in full the code you ran, the traceback you got if
there's an error, and your Python environment (e.g., using `pykeen version` and
pasting the output)

Format your text nicely using GitHub-flavored Markdown so it's easier to read
and has extra semantics

Be considerate of the PyKEEN team's and other community members' time. Did you
carefully look into your issue, e.g., reading previous issues/discussions on
PyKEEN's repository or using StackOverflow? Please describe what you have tried
before asking others to invest time solving your problem.

If you're soliciting feedback/support within the scope of a non-academic job,
then consider financially supporting the project

Conversely, if you're soliciting feedback/support within the scope of your
thesis or homework, then consider that you should be training on how to figure
stuff out for yourself
