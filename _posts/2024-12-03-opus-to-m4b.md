Brandon Sanderson has been releasing a few chapters a week of his upcoming
novel, [Wind and Truth](https://bioregistry.io/isbn:1250319188), on his
publisher's website leading up to its December 6<sup>th</sup> release. This
includes the audiobook chapters, but they're posted to Soundcloud and there's no
good way to listen at 1.6x speed. This post is a note sheet on how to download
audio from Soundcloud and prepare it for my audiobook reader.

## Get a package manager

First step is to get [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). I've been very
excited to watch this fast tool replace many iffy Python packaging tools!

```console
$ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

See also the full
[installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

## Install the downloader tool

[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) is _a feature-rich command-line
audio/video downloader with support for
[thousands of sites](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md)_.

Second step is to install `yt-dlp` using `uv tool install`. uv installs the tool
and its CLI in an isolated virtual environment but makes it available globally
on your system.

```console
$ uv tool install yt-dlp
Resolved 1 package in 106ms
Installed 1 package in 28ms
 + yt-dlp==2024.11.18
Installed 1 executable: yt-dlp
```

Look how fast it installs with a warm cache!

## Download the audio

The chapters for _Wind and Truth_ are indexed
[here](https://reactormag.com/columns/wind-and-truth/). For example, you can
navigate to
[interludes 3 and 4](https://reactormag.com/read-wind-and-truth-by-brandon-sanderson-interludes-3-and-4/),
scroll to the bottom, then open the Soundcloud embed in a new browser tab and
copy the URL.

Third step is to invoke `yt-dlp` from the console with the URL as the only
argument (in quotes!). The best thing about this tool is that it has a
plugin-based architecture, so it can deal with basically anything you give it.

```console
$ yt-dlp "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1931715512%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-WvtAtAMqqkc&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"

## Convert the audio's format

The only issue is that it gives output in the
[Opus](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_(audio_format)>) file format, which
isn't so easy to use. The fourth step is to convert this to
[m4b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP4_file_format#Filename_extensions) for
easy use with an audiobook reader. After installing ffmpeg (e.g., with
`brew install ffmpeg`), run

```shell
$ ffmpeg \
    -i "Interludes - WIND AND TRUTH by Brandon Sanderson, narrated by Kate Reading and Michael Kramer [1931715512].opus" \
    -c:a aac -b:a 128k -vn -f ipod interludes-3-and-4.m4b

## Easy listening

I'm using [BookPlayer](https://github.com/TortugaPower/BookPlayer), an open
source project to listen to books. I usually sync them by using AirDrop to send
the m4b files to my phone, then using its import menu.

Happy listening!

P.S., I wrote
[a script](https://gist.github.com/cthoyt/62b26908b8822a7596c6b663ee910d5f) that
automates crawling the Wind and Truth index, downloading, and converting these
files.
