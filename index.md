I’m working towards building my own research group focused on software development, data standardization/FAIRification/integration, and 
applications of ML/AI in the chemical, biological, and health sciences - specifically in drug discovery and precision medicine.

I’m interested in building academic collaborations that can lead to grant
opportunities and securing project contracts for unmet business needs addressed
by the semantic technologies and capabilities that I've developed and write
about here.
