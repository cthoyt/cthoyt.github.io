My name is Charles Tapley Hoyt. I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School 
working remotely from Germany. I'm working in bio/cheminformatics - more specifically using 
biological knowledge graphs to generate testable hypotheses for drug discovery and 
precision medicine.

Here's some more details [about me](/about.md) and [my research](/research.md). My résumé can be
