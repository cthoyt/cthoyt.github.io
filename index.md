&nbsp;I’m working towards building a research group in the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry at RWTH Aachen
University focused on software development, data standardization/FAIRification/integration, and 
applications of ML/AI in the chemical, biological, and health sciences - specifically in drug discovery and precision medicine.

I’m interested in building academic collaborations that can lead to grant
opportunities and securing project contracts for unmet business needs addressed
by the semantic technologies and capabailities that I've developed and write
about here.
