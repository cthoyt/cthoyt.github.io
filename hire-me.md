### Public Projects

My employer, RWTH Aachen University, charges at cost for human resources, plus
around a 50% overhead for administration and facilities.

Costs are standardized for German public employees by the
[Tarifvertrag für den öffentlichen Dienst (TVöD)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarifvertrag_f%C3%BCr_den_%C3%B6ffentlichen_Dienst)
pay scale, which incorporates qualifications and experience.

For projects that I lead, I book (at maximum) at the
[E14 Stufe 3](https://www.jobs-beim-staat.de/tarif/tvoed-bund_e14) rate, which
is 5,928 €/month as of January 2026. This means that a contract, with overhead,
can be roughly estimated at 9,000€/month, or 52€/hour.

While it would be more lucrative to run projects privately, I currently prefer
to run projects through the university as funding is tied to career progression
towards the rank of professor.

### Privacy and Non-disclosure Agreements

I am able to participate in (mutual) non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) for
university-scoped projects through the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry at RWTH
Aachen University.

I am also able to privately sign NDAs, but not in parallel with nor before a
university NDA, i.e., it's not possible to sign a personal NDA for development
of a project that would be run through the university.
